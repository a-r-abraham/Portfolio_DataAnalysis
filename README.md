Description: This is my final project for Applied Statistics in Health at UTRGV. I wanted to explore how political party affiliation could impact healthcare decision making by comparing COVID vaccination rates between blue states and red states. I first prove there is a difference between vaccination rates in the two groups (hypothesis testing through t-test/wilson rank sum). Then I delve into some of the factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy. 

Part 1: Webscraping

I webscraped from two different sites and 1 online pdf to get relevant data (election results, vaccination data, political state ranking).

Language: Python

Skills: webscraping, BeautifulSoup, numpy, pandas, requests, html.parser

Part 2: Data Cleaning

I cleaned up each of the three tables and combined everything into one dataframe, which was then exported as a csv file. 
Lanuage: Python 
Skills: data cleaning, numpy, pandas

Part 3/4: Data Visualization & Data Analysis 

I did hypothesis testing (t-testing, wilson rank sum) to find p-values. 
Language: R
Skills: statistical analysis and data visualization
